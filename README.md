# React + TypeScript + Vite + Shadcn + Tailwind CSS

This project is based on an idea shared by Corina Udrescu in this page https://reactpractice.dev/exercise/build-a-budget-app-dashboard/.
As an enhancement it could be fine to add a BE layer (with ORM) in order to connect to a DB and get real data.


I started the proyect with React, TS and Vite then added Tailwind and shadcn components.

As another enhancement it would be fine to add unit tests.

You already know how to run the project. Clone it then

npm run install

npm run dev
